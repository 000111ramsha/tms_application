## Implementation Details

### Component Location
```
src/components/ModernDatePicker.js
```

### Usage in HomeScreen
```javascript
<ModernDatePicker
  value={fields.date}
  onDateChange={(date) => setField("date", date)}
  placeholder="Select Preferred Date"
  error={errors.date}
  onFocus={() => clearError("date")}
  onBlur={() => {}}
  style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}
/>
```

### Form State Changes
- **Date field type**: Changed from `string` to `Date` object
- **Initial value**: Changed from `""` to `null`
- **Validation**: Updated to work with Date objects instead of string validation

### Dependencies Used
- `@react-native-community/datetimepicker` - Core date picker functionality
- `@expo/vector-icons` - Calendar and chevron icons
- React Native's built-in components for styling and animations

## User Experience

### Date Selection Flow
1. User taps on the date picker field
2. **iOS**: Modal slides up from bottom with spinner picker
3. **Android**: Native date picker dialog appears
4. User can only select dates from tomorrow onwards
5. Selected date is formatted and displayed (e.g., "Mon, Dec 25, 2024")
6. Form validates the selection automatically

### Visual States
- **Default**: Clean white background with calendar icon
- **Focused**: Subtle animation and visual feedback
- **Error**: Red border and error message with alert icon
- **Disabled**: Grayed out appearance (if needed)

### Date Format
- Display format: "Weekday, Month Day, Year" (e.g., "Mon, Dec 25, 2024")
- Internal format: JavaScript Date object
- Validation: Ensures date is in the future

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: No more manual date entry with potential formatting errors
2. **Validation**: Automatic prevention of invalid date selections
3. **Consistency**: Matches the app's design language
4. **Accessibility**: Full support for users with disabilities
5. **Cross-platform**: Works seamlessly on both iOS and Android
6. **Future-proof**: Easy to extend with additional features

## Technical Notes

### Minimum Date Logic
```javascript
const getMinimumDate = () => {
  const tomorrow = new Date();
  tomorrow.setDate(tomorrow.getDate() + 1);
  tomorrow.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  return tomorrow;
};
```

### Date Validation
```javascript
// Ensures selected date is not today or in the past
const today = new Date();
today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);

const selectedDate = new Date(fields.date);
selectedDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);

if (selectedDate <= today) {
  newErrors.date = "Please select a future date.";
  valid = false;
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Time selection in addition to date
- Custom date ranges for different consultation types
- Holiday/weekend restrictions
- Multiple date selection for recurring appointments
- Integration with calendar apps
- Timezone handling for different locations

## Testing

To test the date picker:
1. Navigate to the HomeScreen
2. Scroll to the contact form
3. Tap on the date field
4. Try selecting today's date (should be disabled)
5. Try selecting a past date (should be disabled)
6. Select a future date (should work)
7. Submit the form to see validation in action

The implementation ensures a smooth, intuitive experience while preventing users from selecting invalid dates.
